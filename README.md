There are some docs on setting up a local sensor: https://github.com/home-assistant/example-custom-config/tree/master/custom_components/example_sensor

## Status

The basic script inside "original_coding" is working, although I have sensitive data saved in there, which will need tidying up

## Next steps

- Setup a local homeassistant just for debugging this - https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/development_environment/
- Play with my integration, as it looks promising


## Local Setup

- Run the steps outlined on https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/development_environment/
  - My local repo is https://github.com/retrodans/home-assistant-core
